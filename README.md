Steps I took:
1.) Panic
2.) Created a new db -> personal1
3.) set password and login for db
3.) created a module under the inventory category named Quantity Manager
4.) Now since I have a base to work from I will try to understand the task by going through the work flow
5.) This step I am going to install the applications that I think will be necessary for this task in my fresh database
Apps: Inventory, Receipts, Purchase
